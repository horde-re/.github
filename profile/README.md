## üìç Overview

Horde is a comprehensive suite of binary analysis tools designed for reverse engineering, developed in Rust with Python bindings. It simplifies tasks like analyzing, modifying, and generating binary programs through various advanced techniques. Inspired by projects like [angr](https://github.com/angr/angr) and [miasm](https://github.com/cea-sec/miasm), Horde aims to streamline complex reverse engineering workflows for a wide range of architectures.

### üöÄ Motivations

This project is motivated by the need to unify diverse binary analysis utilities into a **cohesive**, **extensible** framework.

Unlike existing tools that often specialize in specific areas, Horde integrates capabilities like intermediate representation (via [GTIRB](https://github.com/grammatech/gtirb)), dynamic program instrumentation (with [Intel Pin](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/tool/pin-a-dynamic-binary-instrumentation-tool.html)), symbolic execution (using [Triton](https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/Triton)), and disassembly (leveraging [ddisasm](https://github.com/GrammaTech/ddisasm/), [souffle](https://github.com/souffle-lang/souffle) and [capstone](https://github.com/capstone-engine/capstone)) under a single ecosystem, without reinventing the wheel.

Its innovative approach lies in offering a seamless interface in Rust and Python, with plans to expand bindings to other languages, enabling flexibility and accessibility for developers and researchers. By merging these powerful tools, Horde minimizes the fragmentation of reverse engineering workflows, offering a centralized and efficient solution for tasks ranging from binary rewriting to advanced program analysis.

This integration, coupled with Rust's performance and safety guarantees, makes Horde a compelling choice for anyone seeking a modern and versatile reverse engineering framework.
